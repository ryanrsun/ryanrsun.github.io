#### <a name="GEint"></a>[R/GEint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GEint/index.html)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package with tools for inference on gene-environment interaction effects. Current developmental version is also available at [Github](https://www.github.com/ryanrsun/GEint).

---

#### <a name="GBJ"></a>[R/GBJ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GBJ/index.html)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to calculate the Generalized Berk-Jones statistic and p-value for set-based inference in genetic association studies.
Also computes the Generalized Higher Criticism and Minimum p-value statistics.  Current developmental version is also available at [Github](https://www.github.com/ryanrsun/GBJ).

---

#### <a name="reconstructKM"></a>[R/reconstructKM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reconstructKM/index.html) 

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to reconstruct individual-level data from Kaplan-Meier plots published in academic journals. Current developmental version is also available at [Github](https://www.github.com/ryanrsun/reconstructKM).

---
 
#### <a name="ICSKAT"></a>[R/ICSKAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICSKAT/index.html) 
 
An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to perform the interval-censored sequence kernel association test. Current developmental version is also available at [Github](https://www.github.com/ryanrsun/ICSKAT).

---

#### <a name="csmGmm"></a>[R/csmGmm](https://github.com/ryanrsun/csmGmm)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to perform large-scale composite null hypothesis testing with the conditionally symmetric Gaussian mixture model.

---

#### <a name="SIMICO"></a>[R/SIMICO](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIMICO/index.html)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to perform the interval-censored sequence kernel association test simultaneously with multiple outcomes. 

---

#### <a name="DBpower"></a>[R/DBpower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBpower/index.html)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to calculate power bounds and exact power (small sets only) for detection boundary tests (e.g. Berk-Jones, Generalized Berk-Jones, innovated Berk-Jones) used in set-based inference studies.

---

#### <a name="crSKAT"></a>[R/crSKAT](https://github.com/zhichaoxu04/crSKAT)

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to perform the interval-censored sequence kernel association test in the presence of a competing risk.
